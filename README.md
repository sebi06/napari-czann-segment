Semantic Segmentation using DeepLearning ONNX models packaged as *.czann files.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Installation

Before installing, please setup a conda environment. If you have never worked with conda environments, go through [this tutorial](https://biapol.github.io/blog/johannes_mueller/anaconda_getting_started/) first.

You can then install `napari-czann-segment` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-czann-segment

## What does the plugin do

The plugin allows you to:

- Use a *.czann file containing the Deep Neural Network (ONNX) for semantic segmentation and metadata
- Segmentation will be applied per 2D plane for all dimensions
- Processing larger multi-dimensional images it uses the [cztile] package to chunk the individual 2d arrays using a specific overlap.

## What does the plugin NOT do

**Before one can actually use a model it needs to be trained, which is NOT done by this plugin**.

Therer two main ways hwo such a model can be created:

- Train the segmentation model fully automated on [APEER] and download the *.czann file
- Train your model in a Jupyter notebook etc. and package it using the [czmodel] python package as an *.czann


## Using this plugin

### Sample Data

A test image and a *.czann model file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/sebi06/napari-czann-segment/tree/main/src/napari_czann_segment/_data).

- `PGC_20X.ome.tiff` --> use `PGC_20X_nucleus_detector.czann` to segment

In order to use this plugin the user has to do the following things:

- Open the image using "File - Open Files(s)" (requires [napari-aicsimageio] plugin).
- Click **napari-czann-segment: Segment with CZANN model** in the "Plugins" menu.
- **Select a *.czann file** to use the model for segmentation.

![Napari - Image loaded and czann selected](https://github.com/sebi06/napari-czann-segment/raw/main/readme_images/napari_czann1.png)

- Adjust the **minimum overlap** used to the tiling (optional).
- Select the **layer** to be segmented.
- Press **Segment Selected Image Layer** to run the segmentation.

A successful is obviously only the starting point for further image analysis steps to extract the desired numbers from the segmented image. Another example is shown below demonstrating a simple "Grain Size Analysis" using a deep-learning model trained on [APEER] used in [napari]

### Remarks

> **IMPORTANT**: Currently the plugin only supports using models trained on a **single channel** image. Therefore make sure that during the training on [APEER] or somewhere else the correct inputs images are used.
> It is quite simple to train an single RGB image, which actually has three channels, load this image in [napari] and notice only then that the model will not work, because the image will 3 channels inside [napari].

- Only the CPU will be used for the inference using the ONNX runtime for the [ONNX-CPU] runtime
- GPUs are not supported yet and will require [ONNX-GPU] runtime

## For developers

- **Please clone this repository first using your favorite tool.**

- **Ideally one creates a new [conda] environment or use an existing environment that already contains [Napari].**

Feel free to create a new environment using the [YAML](env_napari_czann_segment.yml) file at your own risk:

    cd the-github-repo-with-YAML-file
    conda env create --file conda_env_napari_czann_segment.yml
    conda activate napari_czmodel

- **Install the plugin locally**

Please run the the following command:

    pip install -e .

To install latest development version:

    pip install git+https://github.com/sebi06/napari_czann_segment.git
